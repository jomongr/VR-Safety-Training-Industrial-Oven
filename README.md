## 📌 Overview
This project is an immersive **Virtual Reality (VR) safety training system** developed using Unity. It simulates industrial oven environments to train workers in handling hazardous situations safely, eliminating real-world risks while enhancing operational compliance and emergency response skills.

## 🎯 Objectives
* **Realistic Training:** Provide a lifelike industrial environment for hands-on learning.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Simulate high-risk scenarios (gas leaks, fires) safely.
* **Decision Making:** Improve user response time during critical emergencies.
* **Accident Reduction:** Lower workplace injury rates through repeatable, data-driven training.
